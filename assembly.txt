!	bootsect.s		(C) 1991 Linus Torvalds
!
! bootsect.s is loaded at 0x7c00 by the bios-startup routines, and moves
! iself out of the way to address 0x90000, and jumps there.
!
! It then loads 'setup' directly after itself (0x90200), and the system
! at 0x10000, using BIOS interrupts. 
!
! NOTE! currently system is at most 8*65536 bytes long. This should be no
! problem, even in the future. I want to keep it simple. This 512 kB
! kernel size should be enough, especially as this doesn't contain the
! buffer cache as in minix
!
! The loader has been made as simple as possible, and continuos
! read errors will result in a unbreakable loop. Reboot by hand. It
! loads pretty fast by getting whole sectors at a time whenever possible.

!
! setup.s is responsible for getting the system data from the BIOS,
! and putting them into the appropriate places in system memory.
! both setup.s and system has been loaded by the bootblock.
!
! This code asks the bios for memory/disk/other parameters, and
! puts them in a "safe" place: 0x90000-0x901FF, ie where the
! boot-block used to be. It is then up to the protected mode
! system to read them from there before the area is overwritten
! for buffer-blocks.
!

! NOTE! These had better be the same as in bootsect.s!
